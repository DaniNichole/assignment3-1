Hello Darien,

So first there are a couple semicolons that are missing on lines: 92, 136, 141, 149 after I added in the semicolons it worked great.
Secondly I love how you changed the messages after you selected a TeaStrength. It made it unique and a tad bit funny.
Overall your code is great and i like how you made barriers so that you can see all the different portions of the app.
